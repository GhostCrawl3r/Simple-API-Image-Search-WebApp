## Trello List
If you're interested in seeing what updates I will be doing / have fixed check out this Trello Board: https://trello.com/b/OAaV5uJ6/image-search

Sadly I got the bright idea to make this board 3 days into the project, so a lot of the earlier things aren't on here. However, most of the earlier stuff was me fiddling with CSS, so you didn't miss much!
